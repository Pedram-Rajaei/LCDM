def particle_filter_multi_trial(state: State, num_particles, T, y_all_trials, num_trials, model, labels):
    """
    Run the particle filter algorithm for multiple trials and return particles and estimated states for each trial.

    Parameters:
        state (State): The state object containing system parameters (A, B, C, D, Q, R).
        num_particles (int): Number of particles to simulate.
        T (int): Number of time steps.
        y_all_trials (ndarray): Observations for all trials.
        num_trials (int): Number of trials to run.
        model (torch.nn.Module): Neural network model to evaluate particles.
        labels (ndarray): Ground-truth labels for each trial.

    Returns:
        ndarray: Array containing all particles for each trial, time step, and state dimension.
